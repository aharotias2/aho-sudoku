Aho-Sudoku
====================================================================================================
This is a game application of SUDOKU (数独).

The rule is simple: There is 9 x 9 cells in a field.
Cells are divided into 3 x 3 blocks.
You should put numbers from 1 to 9 in all cells.
And you are not allowed to put the same numbers in one rows, columns, and 3 x 3 blocks at the same
time.
Can you understand reading this explanation?
If no, Google will help you.

Caution: There are combinations of numbers that are correct, but I can't say that you can always
guess by looking at the numbers you see.

We strongly recommend that you do not play this game seriously.

It can be in a dark mode.
